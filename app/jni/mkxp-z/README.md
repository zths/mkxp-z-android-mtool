# mkxp-z (Android/JNI part)

This folder contains source files from [mkxp-z](https://github.com/mkxp-z/mkxp-z)
for building mkxp-z for Android.

Since this is not a git module, I can't fork the same mkxp-z repository
more than one, so I have clone here instead of making git module
with dedicated mkxp-z fork for Android only.

Readme header fragment from mkxp-z:
> This is a fork of mkxp intended to be a little more than just a barebones
> recreation of RPG Maker.
> The original goal was successfully running games based on
> Pokemon Essentials, which is notoriously dependent on Windows APIs.
> I'd consider that mission accomplished.
